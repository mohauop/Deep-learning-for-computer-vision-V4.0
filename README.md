this is a deep learning workshop done in Wameedh Scientific CLub.

We Started by:
1.learning the Concept of Machine Learning throughout linear regression and logistic regression.
2.Introducing the different Machine Learning algorithms like : decision tree, random forest , Support vector machine and some codes
3.linear regression full explanation with code and introducing neural networks; and giving a task in logistic regression
4.Starting with deep learning by introducing deep learning algorithms like: deep neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Long short term memory, Transformer model, Generative adversial networks , and Convolutional neural networks.
5.diving deep into Convolutional neural networks by explaining each layer and introducing Pytorch framework.
6.simple project code demonstration of VGG19 classification model for flower classification; and a task to be done classification.





# Some Resources :

diving deep into the concepts of Machine learning and deep learning, i recommend andrew ng courses on deeplearning.ai :
        Machine Learning Specialization : https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/
        Deep Learning specialization : https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/

To have a good visual understanding of neural networks, i recommend : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi


for the ones who want accelerated learning, you can see the MIT course with labs : http://introtodeeplearning.com/ with corresponding videos : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTZ1bhP8GBuTCqeY19TxhHyrwFiot42_U

# virtual environments :
virtual environements are very important in handling dependencies, for each AI project you need certain some dependencies, so , if you have many projects, there will be errors in dependencies , for example if project1 requires pytorch V1.0 and project2 requires pytorch V2.0 ==> THIS WILL RESULT AN ERROR.
in that case we use virtual environement so that we can install for each project its requirements.
# Available environments that i am aware of :
conda  ; venv 
you can use either one of them.
PS: venv is faster that conda.
